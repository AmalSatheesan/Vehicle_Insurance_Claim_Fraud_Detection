    "# Vehicle Insurance Claim Fraud Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Insurance fraud poses a significant risk to insurance companies, resulting in increased claim costs and operational inefficiencies. Detecting fraudulent claims early is crucial to minimize losses and optimize investigation efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent vehicle insurance claims using historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Formulation\n",
    "- **Type:** Supervised Machine Learning\n",
    "- **Task:** Binary Classification\n",
    "- **Target Variable:**\n",
    "  - `1` → Fraudulent claim\n",
    "  - `0` → Genuine claim\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Strategy\n",
    "Given the imbalanced nature of fraud detection datasets, the primary evaluation focus will be on:\n",
    "- Recall\n",
    "- Precision\n",
    "- F1-Score\n",
    "- ROC-AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy alone is not considered a reliable performance measure for this problem.\n"
